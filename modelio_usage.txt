Usage:

import modelio
modelio.save(model, data_direction, notes='')
modelio.load(filename)

----------------------------------------------------

To SAVE a model you've created, call

modelio.save(model, data_direction, notes='')

model is the model object you'd like to save
data_direction is the name (including path if it's in a different folder) of .csv file you used to train this model
notes is optional for you to put any extra notes you want to save about this model (for example, which feature was used in this model, wIt should be easy to use, I will write a readme file and upload it lateras this a model from cv or whole dataset,etc

The program will save the model (as a binary file) together with a log in model directory, the log contains following information:

-creater of model
-type of model (linear/decision tree/gkrr etc.)
-name of the data file
-time of creation
-extra notes you made

-a backup of the binary file


There will also be an all_log.txt file to save the log of all the model you've created

All the above files will be saved in "model/" directory
The name of the binary file is <author>_<time-stamp>_<counter> and the name of log is <author>_<time-stamp>_<counter>_log.txt

The <counter> is to avoid overwritten if you write several files in the same second
If the data_direction cannot be found, the save will not be successful

The method will return the name of the created binary file if save is successful, None otherwise

----------------------------------------------------

To LOAD a model you've saved, call

modelio.load(filename)

It will search the filename in both 'model/' and current directory

The method will return the model if load is successful, None otherwise.

----------------------------------------------------

USAGE EXAMPLE:

If dtmodel is a decision tree model trained by data file "data/dbtt.csv". I can save the model by calling:

modelio.save(dtmodel, "data/dbtt.csv", "an example note")

2 files will be created in model/ directory:

haotian_2016-05-24_14:39:57_1
haotian_2016-05-24_14:39:57_1_log.txt

Following information is included in the log:
------------------
creator:	haotian
model type:	DecisionTreeRegressor
based on data:	data/dbtt.csv
created time:	2016-05-24_14:39:57
notes:	an example note

binary backup (DO NOT MODIFY!)
<a very very long binary string will be shown here>
-------------------

and following information will be added to the all_log.txt:
-------------------
filename:	haotian_2016-05-24_14:39:57
creator:	haotian
model type:	DecisionTreeRegressor
based on data:	data/dbtt.csv
created time:	2016-05-24_14:39:57
notes:	an example note
-------------------

If you want to load this model in the future, call:

dtmodel = modelio.load('haotian_2016-05-24_14:39:57')

or

dtmodel = modelio.load('model/haotian_2016-05-24_14:39:57')

this will return the model exactly as how you saved it.
